This project was my team's submission for HackCooper2019. Our idea was to create a website that did the following:
* convert books written in English to books written in Braille
* contain a library of books already written in Braille
 
In order to do this we had to first create a Braille Translator. Our team created the Braille Translator in two different ways. The first method was coding a C++ file that converts user input in English to Braille. The other method was creating HTML, Javascript, and CSS files that collectively worked together to also convert user input in English to Braille.

Our project could be upgraded by:
* ~~adding more Braille symbols~~
* implementing a tool that takes in English books and converts them to Braille books
* saving the converted books in a library on the site
* making the Braille actually readable by those who are blind
